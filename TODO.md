# TODO

## Completed
- [x] Fix UserRowView.swift structural issues - functions need to be outside body property
- [x] Implement lazy loading functionality with parallel user fetching
- [x] Add debug logs to track user loading progress

## Current Implementation

### Lazy Loading Architecture
- **UserListView**: Manages user IDs and fetches user objects in parallel
- **fetchUsersInParallel()**: Uses `withTaskGroup` to fetch multiple users concurrently
- **Individual User Updates**: Each user appears in the UI as soon as it's fetched, not waiting for the entire batch
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track the loading process

### Key Features
- ✅ **Parallel Fetching**: Multiple users are fetched simultaneously using Swift concurrency
- ✅ **Lazy Display**: Users appear individually as they complete loading
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Failed user fetches don't block other users
- ✅ **Pagination**: Load more users as user scrolls down
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Track loading progress with detailed console output

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the lazy loading functionality in the app
- [ ] Monitor console logs to verify individual user loading
- [ ] Optimize performance if needed
