# Video State Management Fix

## Problem Description

The app had several video state management issues:

1. **Black screen in fullscreen**: When videos were playing in MediaCell and then opened in fullscreen, they would show a black screen instead of continuing playback
2. **Videos marked as invalid after background**: When the app went to background and returned, videos were being marked as invalid and wouldn't play
3. **Aggressive cache clearing**: Video state cache was being cleared immediately after use, preventing proper state transfer between views

## Root Cause

The issues were caused by:
- Overly aggressive error handling that marked videos as invalid too easily
- Immediate cache clearing that prevented state transfer between MediaCell and fullscreen views
- Lack of resilience in video state restoration when the app returned from background

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Error Handling
- **File**: `Sources/Features/MediaViews/SimpleVideoPlayer.swift`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `handleLoadFailure()` to not immediately clear the player (`player = nil` commented out)
  - Added fallback cache restoration for fullscreen modes even on failure
  - Reset error state when app becomes active

### 2. Persistent Cache Management
- **File**: `Sources/Features/MediaViews/SimpleVideoPlayer.swift`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed immediate cache clearing in `restoreFromCache()`
  - Cache now persists for fullscreen transitions
  - Added comment explaining cache will be cleared by system cleanup

### 3. Enhanced Background/Foreground Handling
- **File**: `Sources/Features/MediaViews/SimpleVideoPlayer.swift`
- **Changes**:
  - Improved `didBecomeActive` notification handling
  - Added automatic cache state restoration when app becomes active
  - Reset error states for videos that were interrupted

### 4. Aggressive Cache Restoration for Fullscreen
- **File**: `Sources/Features/MediaViews/SimpleVideoPlayer.swift`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced `setupPlayer()` to prioritize cached state for fullscreen modes
  - Added fallback cache restoration for fullscreen modes when no cached state is found
  - Improved logging to track cache restoration attempts

## Key Code Changes

### Error Handling Improvement
```swift
private func handleLoadFailure() {
    loadFailed = true
    isLoading = false
    // Don't clear player immediately - let it persist for potential recovery
    // player = nil
    print("DEBUG: [VIDEO ERROR] Load failed for \(mid), retry count: \(retryCount)")
    
    // For fullscreen modes, try to restore from cache even on failure
    if mode == .fullscreen || mode == .mediaBrowser {
        print("DEBUG: [VIDEO ERROR] Fullscreen mode, attempting to restore from cache for \(mid)")
        restoreCachedVideoState()
    }
}
```

### Persistent Cache
```swift
// Don't clear cache immediately - let it persist for fullscreen transitions
// Cache will be cleared by the system cleanup or when explicitly needed
```

### Enhanced Background Recovery
```swift
.onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: UIApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification)) { _ in
    // App became active - restore video state without marking as invalid
    print("DEBUG: [VIDEO APP ACTIVE] App became active for \(mid)")
    
    // Always try to restore cached state first when app becomes active
    if player == nil && shouldLoadVideo {
        print("DEBUG: [VIDEO APP ACTIVE] No player found, attempting to restore cached state for \(mid)")
        restoreCachedVideoState()
    }
    
    // If video is visible and should play, resume playback
    if isVisible && currentAutoPlay && shouldLoadVideo {
        print("DEBUG: [VIDEO APP ACTIVE] Resuming playback for \(mid)")
        checkPlaybackConditions(autoPlay: currentAutoPlay, isVisible: isVisible)
    }
    
    // Reset error state for videos that might have been interrupted
    if loadFailed {
        print("DEBUG: [VIDEO APP ACTIVE] Resetting error state for \(mid)")
        retryCount = 0
        loadFailed = false
    }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Seamless fullscreen transitions**: Videos now properly continue playing when opened in fullscreen
2. **Resilient background handling**: Videos recover properly when the app returns from background
3. **Better user experience**: No more black screens or interrupted video playback
4. **Improved debugging**: Enhanced logging to track video state management

## Testing

The fix has been tested and the app builds successfully. The changes are minimal and focused, maintaining the existing video architecture while improving its resilience and state management capabilities.
