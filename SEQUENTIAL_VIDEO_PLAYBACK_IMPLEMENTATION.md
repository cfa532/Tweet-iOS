# Sequential Video Playback Implementation

## Overview

The Tweet-iOS app now supports **sequential video playback** in media grids and has been configured with a **maximum concurrent video loading limit of 5**. This implementation ensures that when multiple videos are present in a single media grid, they play one after another automatically, providing a smooth user experience.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Sequential Video Playback ✅
- **Multiple videos in a grid play sequentially** - When a video finishes, the next video automatically starts
- **Automatic progression** - No user interaction required to move between videos
- **Smart state management** - Videos maintain their individual states while coordinating playback

### 2. Increased Concurrent Loading Limit ✅
- **Maximum concurrent video loading: 5** (increased from 3)
- **Performance optimized** - Balances loading speed with system resources
- **Simplified architecture** - Only `VideoLoadingManager` manages concurrent loading

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. VideoManager (`Sources/Utils/VideoManager.swift`)
The central coordinator for sequential playback:

```swift
class VideoManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentVideoIndex: Int = -1
    @Published var videoMids: [String] = []
    @Published var isSequentialPlaybackEnabled: Bool = false
    
    func setupSequentialPlayback(for mids: [String]) {
        videoMids = mids
        currentVideoIndex = 0
        isSequentialPlaybackEnabled = mids.count > 1
    }
    
    func onVideoFinished() {
        let nextIndex = currentVideoIndex + 1
        if nextIndex < videoMids.count {
            currentVideoIndex = nextIndex
        } else {
            // All videos finished
            stopSequentialPlayback()
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. MediaGridView (`Sources/Features/MediaViews/MediaGridView.swift`)
Orchestrates video playback setup:

```swift
// Setup sequential playback for videos
let videoMids = attachments.enumerated().compactMap { index, attachment in
    if attachment.type == .video || attachment.type == .hls_video {
        return attachment.mid
    }
    return nil
}

if videoMids.count > 1 {
    videoManager.setupSequentialPlayback(for: videoMids)
    print("DEBUG: [MediaGridView] Setup sequential playback for \(videoMids.count) videos")
}
```

#### 3. MediaCell (`Sources/Features/MediaViews/MediaCell.swift`)
Individual video cell management:

```swift
SimpleVideoPlayer(
    url: url,
    mid: attachment.mid,
    isVisible: isVisible,
    autoPlay: videoManager.shouldPlayVideo(for: attachment.mid),
    videoManager: videoManager,
    onVideoFinished: onVideoFinished,
    // ... other parameters
)
```

#### 4. SimpleVideoPlayer (`Sources/Features/MediaViews/SimpleVideoPlayer.swift`)
Handles video completion and progression:

```swift
// Call external callback when video finishes
if let onVideoFinished = onVideoFinished {
    onVideoFinished()
}
```

### Concurrent Loading Configuration

#### VideoLoadingManager (`Sources/Core/VideoLoadingManager.swift`)
```swift
private let maxConcurrentLoads: Int = 5 // Increased from 3 to 5 for better performance
```

## How It Works

### 1. Grid Initialization
When a `MediaGridView` appears with multiple videos:

1. **Extract video MIDs** from attachments
2. **Setup sequential playback** if more than one video
3. **Reset all video players** to beginning
4. **Start first video** automatically

### 2. Sequential Progression
When a video finishes playing:

1. **SimpleVideoPlayer** calls `onVideoFinished()`
2. **VideoManager** increments `currentVideoIndex`
3. **MediaCell** observes the change and updates play state
4. **Next video** automatically starts playing

### 3. State Management
- **Single videos**: Play normally without sequential logic
- **Multiple videos**: Coordinate through VideoManager
- **Grid visibility**: Stop playback when grid becomes invisible
- **App lifecycle**: Proper cleanup on disappear

## Performance Optimizations

### Concurrent Loading
- **5 simultaneous video loads** (increased from 3)
- **Queue management** for pending loads
- **Performance monitoring** to prevent system overload
- **Memory pressure detection** and cache cleanup

### Resource Management
- **Shared video player instances** via `SharedAssetCache`
- **LRU cache eviction** for memory efficiency
- **Background cleanup** of unused resources
- **Emergency cleanup** on performance issues

## Debug Information

The system provides comprehensive logging:

```
DEBUG: [MediaGridView] Setup sequential playback for 3 videos
DEBUG: [VideoManager] Video finished, moved to next video: 1
DEBUG: [VideoLoadingManager] Video load started. Active loads: 2
DEBUG: [VideoLoadingManager] Video load completed. Active loads: 1
```

## Usage Examples

### Single Video Grid
- Video plays normally
- No sequential logic applied
- Standard autoplay behavior

### Multiple Video Grid
- Videos play one after another
- Automatic progression
- Seamless user experience

### Video Loading Management
- System tracks active loads
- Prevents overload
- Automatic throttling when needed

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Smooth video progression** in multi-video grids
- **No manual intervention** required
- **Consistent playback behavior**
- **Better performance** with optimized loading

### Technical Benefits
- **Coordinated state management**
- **Efficient resource usage**
- **Scalable architecture**
- **Simplified loading management**

## Configuration

### Current Settings
- **Max concurrent loads**: 5 videos
- **Sequential playback**: Enabled for 2+ videos
- **Video loading management**: Active
- **Memory management**: Optimized

### Customization
To adjust the concurrent loading limit, modify:
1. `VideoLoadingManager.maxConcurrentLoads`

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- ✅ **Build verification** - No compilation errors
- ✅ **Single video grids** - Normal playback
- ✅ **Multiple video grids** - Sequential progression
- ✅ **Performance limits** - Concurrent loading management
- ✅ **Memory management** - Resource cleanup

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **User controls** for sequential playback
- **Playback speed** customization
- **Loop options** for video sequences
- **Advanced preloading** strategies

---

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

The sequential video playback system is now active and ready for use. Multiple videos in media grids will automatically play sequentially, and the system can handle up to 5 concurrent video loads for optimal performance. The PerformanceMonitor has been completely removed, simplifying the architecture while maintaining all functionality.
