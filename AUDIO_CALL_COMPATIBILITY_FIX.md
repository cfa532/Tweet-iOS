# Audio Call Compatibility Fix

## Problem Description

The Tweet iOS app was blocking incoming calls in communication apps such as Line and WeChat. This was caused by improper audio session configuration that interfered with the audio routing needed for incoming calls.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `DetailVideoManager` class in `Sources/Core/SingletonVideoManagers.swift`. The audio session was configured with:

```swift
try audioSession.setCategory(.playback, mode: .default, options: [.mixWithOthers])
```

The `.playback` category, even with `.mixWithOthers` option, can still interfere with incoming calls in communication apps because it takes control of the audio session in a way that blocks the audio routing needed for call notifications and ringtones.

## Solution

### 1. Created AudioSessionManager

A new centralized audio session manager (`Sources/Core/AudioSessionManager.swift`) was created to handle all audio session configuration with call-friendly settings:

```swift
// Use .ambient category with .mixWithOthers to allow incoming calls
// This category is designed for background audio that shouldn't interfere with calls
try audioSession.setCategory(.ambient, mode: .default, options: [.mixWithOthers])
```

### 2. Key Changes Made

#### AudioSessionManager.swift
- **New centralized audio session management**
- **Call-friendly audio category**: Uses `.ambient` instead of `.playback`
- **Audio interruption handling**: Automatically pauses video playback when calls come in
- **Proper session lifecycle management**: Activates/deactivates audio sessions appropriately

#### SingletonVideoManagers.swift
- **Removed problematic audio session configuration**
- **Integrated with AudioSessionManager** for proper audio handling
- **Added audio interruption notifications**

#### SimpleVideoPlayer.swift
- **Integrated AudioSessionManager** for video playback
- **Automatic audio session activation** when videos start playing

#### SimpleAudioPlayer.swift
- **Integrated AudioSessionManager** for audio playback
- **Call-friendly audio session handling**

#### TweetApp.swift
- **Initialized AudioSessionManager** during app startup

### 3. Audio Session Categories Explained

#### Before (Problematic)
```swift
.playback // Interferes with calls, takes audio control
```

#### After (Call-Friendly)
```swift
.ambient // Designed for background audio, doesn't interfere with calls
```

### 4. Benefits of the Fix

1. **Call Compatibility**: Incoming calls in Line, WeChat, and other communication apps work properly
2. **Audio Mixing**: App audio can still mix with other audio sources
3. **Automatic Pause**: Videos automatically pause when calls come in
4. **Proper Resume**: Audio session properly resumes after calls end
5. **Centralized Management**: All audio session handling is now centralized and consistent

### 5. Technical Details

#### Audio Session Categories
- **`.ambient`**: Designed for background audio that shouldn't interfere with other apps
- **`.playback`**: Designed for primary audio playback, can interfere with calls
- **`.mixWithOthers`**: Allows mixing with other audio sources

#### Audio Interruption Handling
The AudioSessionManager automatically detects audio interruptions (like incoming calls) and:
1. Pauses all video playback
2. Posts a notification to stop all videos
3. Handles proper resumption after the interruption ends

### 6. Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Start playing a video in the app
2. Have someone call you on Line or WeChat
3. Verify that the call comes through normally
4. Verify that video playback pauses during the call
5. Verify that video playback can resume after the call ends

### 7. Files Modified

- `Sources/Core/AudioSessionManager.swift` (new)
- `Sources/Core/SingletonVideoManagers.swift`
- `Sources/Features/MediaViews/SimpleVideoPlayer.swift`
- `Sources/Features/MediaViews/SimpleAudioPlayer.swift`
- `Sources/App/TweetApp.swift`

### 8. Future Considerations

- Monitor for any audio-related issues in different iOS versions
- Consider adding user preferences for audio behavior
- Test with various communication apps to ensure compatibility
- Consider adding audio session state logging for debugging

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that the Tweet iOS app no longer interferes with incoming calls in communication apps while maintaining proper video and audio playback functionality. The solution uses iOS-recommended audio session practices and provides a robust, centralized approach to audio session management.
