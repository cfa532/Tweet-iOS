- `ChatBubbleShape.swift`: Custom shape for chat message bubbles
- `BadgeView.swift`: Notification badge component for unread messages

### 2. Search System

#### Screens
- `SearchScreen.swift`: User search interface with search bar and results

#### Components
- `SearchViewModel.swift`: Handles search logic and API calls

### 3. Navigation Updates

#### Localization

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- âœ… UI components and screens
- âœ… Navigation integration
- âœ… Localization strings
- âœ… Data models
- âœ… Basic repository structure

### TODO
- ðŸ”„ Integration with HproseInstance for backend communication
- ðŸ”„ Real-time message updates
- ðŸ”„ User avatar loading
- ðŸ”„ Message persistence
- ðŸ”„ Push notifications
- ðŸ”„ Search API integration

## Usage

### Search

## Architecture

The features follow the existing app architecture:
- MVVM pattern with ObservableObject
- SwiftUI for UI components
- Async/await for asynchronous operations
- Localization support for multiple languages

## Migration Notes

This implementation is based on the Android version located at:
`/Users/cfa532/AndroidStudioProjects/Tweet/app/src/main/java/us/fireshare/tweet`

Key differences from Android:
- Uses SwiftUI instead of Jetpack Compose
- iOS-specific navigation patterns
- Swift concurrency instead of Kotlin coroutines
- Core Data integration planned (vs Room in Android)
